# Setup

- Install Python 3.7 64-bit. It's important that you have the 64-bit version to avoid errors with libtcod, which we're using the 64-bit version of.
- Install MinGW: https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/
    - It's not very user-friendly. 
    - Click Basic Packages in the left pane
    - Select MinGW Base. 
    - Top left, click Installation, Apply Changes
- Add MinGW to your PATH
    - Control Panel
    - Search for Environment Variable
    - "Edit the system environment variables"
    - New window, click Environment Variables in the bottom-left
    - Select Path, edit
    - If using the default path, add `C:\MinGW\bin`
- Run setup.bat

# Highly Recommended

I'm using VSCode. I highly suggest you do as well. I have the Python extension installed, along with GitLens.

VSCode may also ask you to install a linter - do so.
